# Extempore

A programming environment for cyberphysical programming.

## Getting started

To get started, you can either download a binary release or build
Extempore from source yourself.

### Download a pre-built binary

Download a
[binary release](https://github.com/digego/extempore/releases), unzip
it and run `extempore.exe` from inside the `extempore` folder.

### Build from source

This will download and build all the dependencies you need (including
LLVM). So, if you've got a C++ compiler (for `gcc`, version 4.9 or
later is required), git and CMake, here are some one-liner build
commands:

On **Linux/macOS**:

    git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore && mkdir extempore/cmake-build && cd extempore/cmake-build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install
    
On **Linux/macOS with JACK**:

    git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore && mkdir extempore/cmake-build && cd extempore/cmake-build && cmake -DJACK=ON .. && make && sudo make install
    
On **Windows**:

    git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore && mkdir extempore/cmake-build && cd extempore/cmake-build && cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" .. && cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release
