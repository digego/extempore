Extempore is a systems programming language designed to support the
programming of real-time systems *in real-time*. Extempore promotes
human orchestration as a meta model of real-time man-machine
interaction in an increasingly distributed and environmentally aware
computing context.

Extempore is designed to support a style of programming dubbed
['cyberphysical' programming](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1869526).
Cyberphysical programming supports the notion of a human programmer
operating as an active agent in a real-time distributed network of
environmentally aware systems. The programmer interacts with the
distributed real-time system procedurally by modifying code
on-the-fly. In order to achieve this level of on-the-fly interaction
Extempore is designed from the ground up to support code hot-swapping
across a distributed heterogeneous network, compiler as service,
real-time task scheduling and a first class semantics for time.

Extempore is designed to mix the high-level expressiveness of Lisp
with the low-level expressiveness of C.  Extempore is a statically
typed, type-inferencing language with strong temporal semantics and
a flexible concurrency architecture in a completely hot-swappable
runtime environment.  Extempore makes extensive use of the LLVM
project to provide back-end code generation across a variety of
architectures.

# Installation

Note: Extempore can make use of various 3rd party libraries if they are
available on your system (Soil, OpenVG, rtmidi, etc').
Support is provided by xtlang wrappers living under libs/external. These
components are optional and you can get up and running with extempore
even if you haven't installed them. The examples which depend on these
libraries will fail to compile and you may simply skip them.

## OSX

If you're a [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) user, it's pretty
straightforward:

```shell
brew tap benswift/extempore
brew install extempore
```

If you get stuck, there are more detailed instructions
[here](http://benswift.me/2013/11/12/building-extempore-through-homebrew/).

Alternately, you can [build it yourself from source](http://benswift.me/2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.html).

## Linux

On Linux, too, you can build Extempore
[through homebrew](http://benswift.me/2013/11/12/building-extempore-through-homebrew/)
or
[build from source](http://benswift.me/2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-osx-linux.html).

## Windows 7

Windows installation instructions are available [here](http://benswift.me/2013-03-20-building-extempore-on-windows.html).

Extempore has thus far only been tested on Windows 7 64-bit, but if you
can get it to build/run on other flavours of Windows then do let us
know and we'll update these instructions.  Also, if anyone wants to
improve and streamline the Windows build process, then patches are
welcome :)

# Running Extempore

You don't need to do anything special to run extempore, it'll just run
in any terminal (or command prompt on Windows).

```shell
$ ./extempore
```

The running extempore process acts as a server, and you send extempore
code to the server for evaluation (by default on port `7099`).Once
you've started extempore you can connect using either telnet,
[Emacs](http://benswift.me/2012/10/10/extempore-emacs-cheat-sheet/),
[vim](http://benswift.me/2014/11/07/hacking-extempore-in-vim/),
[Sublime Text](http://benswift.me/2012/10/23/extempore-st2-cheat-sheet/),
or whatever you like. The Emacs support is probably the most mature at
the moment, but patches are welcome for other editors.

There are some optional command line options that you may want to use
you can get a list by running `./extempore --help`
