# What is extempore?

Extempore is a systems programming language designed to support the
programming of real-time systems *in real-time*. Extempore promotes
human orchestration as a meta model of real-time man-machine
interaction in an increasingly distributed and environmentally aware
computing context.

Extempore is designed to support a style of programming dubbed
['cyberphysical' programming](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1869526).
Cyberphysical programming supports the notion of a human programmer
operating as an active agent in a real-time distributed network of
environmentally aware systems. The programmer interacts with the
distributed real-time system procedurally by modifying code
on-the-fly. In order to achieve this level of on-the-fly interaction
Extempore is designed from the ground up to support code hot-swapping
across a distributed heterogeneous network, compiler as service,
real-time task scheduling and a first class semantics for time.

Extempore is designed to mix the high-level expressiveness of Lisp
with the low-level expressiveness of C.  Extempore is a statically
typed, type-inferencing language with strong temporal semantics and
a flexible concurrency architecture in a completely hot-swappable
runtime environment.  Extempore makes extensive use of the LLVM
project to provide back-end code generation across a variety of
architectures.

# Installation on Linux & OS X

Building Extempore requires some external libraries. Most of the
libraries are pretty standard and will either already be installed on
your system, or can usually be easily installed from binary packages.

OS X:
- `LLVM 3.0`
- `pthread` (if not using `boost`) *or* `boost` (if not using `pthread`)
- `pcre` (Perl-compatible Regular Expressions)
- `portaudio`

Linux:
- `LLVM 3.0`
- `pthread` (if not using `boost`) *or* `boost` (if not using `pthread`)
- `pcre`
- `portaudio v19`
- `mesa GL` (openGL)

LLVM *must* be version 3.0 and needs to be built from source, because
a small patch to `LLParser.cpp` (an LLVM source file) is required. The
patch file `llparser.patch` is supplied in the `extempore/extras`
directory. You can get the LLVM source from http://www.llvm.org/

To apply the patch just move into  `llvm/lib/AsmParser` directory and
then apply the `llparser.patch` file which in can be found in
`extempore/extras`.  For example (change `/path/to/extempore` to
whatever directory you cloned the extempore source code into)

```shell
$ cd /path/to/llvm/lib/AsmParser
$ patch < /path/to/extempore/extras/llparser.patch
```

After that, building LLVM is the usual `./configure; make; make
install` process, with the addition of a `--prefix` location
specifying where everything will be installed into (such as a `Build`
directory)

```shell
$ cd /path/to/llvm
$ mkdir Build
$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/llvm/Build --enable-optimized
$ make -j4
$ make install
```

Once all of the libraries required for your platform (see list above)
are installed, you can compile extempore. First, point extempore to
your LLVM build directory by defining the shell variable
`EXT_LLVM_DIR`, for example

```shell
$ export EXT_LLVM_DIR=/path/to/llvm/Build
```

Then you can build extempore using the `all.bash` shell script 

```shell
$ ./all.bash
```

Voila... you should be done.

The dependencies section above mentions that extempore can be built
with *either* boost or pthreads. At this stage the boost library (if
used) is only used for threading, so unless you have a good reason to
it's probably safer to use pthreads. Still, if you wish to build
against the boost library you need to define `EXT_BOOST`. So the build
command for building extempore with boost support is

```shell
./all.bash -TEXT_BOOST
```

# Installation on Windows 7

Extempore has thus far only been tested on Windows 7 64-bit, but if you
can get it to build/run on other flavours of Windows then do let us
know and we'll update these instructions.  Also, if anyone wants to
improve and streamline the Windows build process, then patches are
welcome :)

On Windows 7, building Extempore requires the following libraries:
- `LLVM 3.0`
- `pcre`
- `boost`
- `portaudio`

Boost is *mandatory* on Windows, and you will need to
build pcre, boost, portaudio and LLVM 3.0 yourself. 

To do this, the source directories will need to be on the 'include path':

- `llvm-3.0`
- `boost_1_47_0`
- `pcre-8.12`
- `portaudio`

Similarly, you'll need to make some directories for the results of
building the above libs

- `my_llvm_build` - use `cmake` to create then build using msvc
- `my_boost_build` - use `bjam` (see below `--build-dir=my_boost_build`)
- `my_pcre_build` - use `cmake` to create then build using msvc
- build `portaudio` using provided msvc project (`portaudio/build/msvc/portaudio.sln`)

LLVM *must* be version 3.0 and needs to be built from source, because
a small patch to `LLParser.cpp` (an LLVM source file) is required. The
patch file `llparser.patch` is supplied in the `extempore/extras`
directory. You can get the LLVM source from http://www.llvm.org/

The `extempore/extras/llparser.patch` file contains the patch, but
because GNU `patch` isn't installed by default on Windows patching
this file isn't quite as simple as it was on Linux/OS X. To apply the
patch on Windows there are a couple of options:

1. Get GNU patch in the form of `patch.exe`
([maybe also check out this advice](http://irq5.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/gnu-patch-and-windows-uac/))
and apply the patch in the same way as is described above in the 'Linux
& OS X section'
2. Apply the patch manually - look at the file
`lib/AsmParser/LLparser.cpp` in the LLVM source directory and the
patch file in a text editor and make the required changes by hand. A
bit cumbersome, but you only have to do it to *compile* extempore.

The extempore build process is pretty simple once you've built the
libraries. The extempore directory expects to find itself in the same
directory as all of the directories mentioned above, although you can
change all of this by manually editing
`extempore/msvc/extempore.vcxproj`.

If you have now built everything successfully you should be able to 
build extempore from the command line.

First set the shell's vc/build environment vars

```
> cd extempore\msvc
> ms_build_vars.bat
```

You'll need a full version of Visual Studio to get the 64bit compiler
(`cl.exe`). Then you can build extempore:
```
> cd extempore
> all.bat
```

And you're done.

*Additional Windows Build Notes*

- Use CMake to build pcre (`my_pcre_build`)
- Use CMake to Build LLVM (choose 64bit option - `my_llvm_build`)
- Make sure that Debug build mode has `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL`=2 set for both 
- `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG` (click advanced checkbox in cmake gui) 
- Make sure portaudio msvc general project settings are set to static lib
- boost command line for bjam is:
```
bjam --build-dir=<dir> toodset=msvc link=static address-model=64 variant=release --build-type=complete stage
```
- extempore msvs project settings needs `PCRE_STATIC` to be defined if you want to build against pcre static libs
- extempore msvs project needs `EXT_BOOST` to be defined
- `pcreposix.lib` needs to come before `pcre.lib` in link list

# Running Extempore

You don't need to do anyting special to run extempore, it'll just run
in any terminal (or command prompt on Windows). 

```shell
$ ./extempore
```

The running extempore process acts as a server, and you send extempore
code to the server for evaluation (by default on port 7099).Once
you've started extempore you can connect using either telnet, Emacs,
vim, sublime text, or whatever you like. The Emacs support is probably
the most mature at the moment, but patches are welcome for other
editors.

There are some optional command line options that you may want to use
you can get a list by running `./extempore --help`

**Telnet**

If using telnet the default extempore port to connect to is `7099`.

**Emacs**

```elisp
(autoload 'extempore-mode "/path/to/extempore/extras/extempore.el" "" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.xtm$" . extempore-mode))
```

After starting Emacs, the steps to get up and running with extempore
are:

1. Open a shell buffer (`M-x shell`), `cd` to the extempore directory
and start it up with `./extempore`
2. Switch to an `.xtm` file (e.g. from the `examples/`
folder) or create a new one
3. You're away. `C-x C-x` will eval an expression and `C-x C-r` will
eval the region

*Version note*: the Emacs major mode (`extempore-mode`) only works
 with Emacs 24 because it inherits from `prog-mode`. If for some
 reason you have to stick on Emacs 23, you can use the Extempore minor
 mode (`extras/extempore-minor.el`).

*Windows note*: if you choose to use emacs on windows (recommended)
and run extempore in a `shell` or `eshell` then you should
set `--term ansi` as an option when starting extempore.

**Vim**

If you want to use (g)vim, see the instructions found in
`extras/extempore.vim`.
