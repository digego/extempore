;; NOTE: the Extempore emacs mode has moved permanently - it's at
;; http://github.com/extemporelang/extempore-emacs-mode

;; prior to Feb 2020 this file had an out-of-date version of that code, which
;; was broken when paired with the latest Extempore. This is obviously a bad
;; state of affairs---so I've removed it, and you should get it from there
;; (either manually or with `M-x package install extempore-mode').
