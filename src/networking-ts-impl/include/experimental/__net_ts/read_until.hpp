 * match.

/// Read data into a dynamic buffer sequence until it contains a specified

/**
 * This function is used to read data into the specified dynamic buffer
 * sequence until the dynamic buffer sequence's get area contains the specified
 * delimiter. The call will block until one of the following conditions is
 * true:
 *
 * @li The get area of the dynamic buffer sequence contains the specified
 * delimiter.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * read_some function. If the dynamic buffer sequence's get area already
 * contains the delimiter, the function returns immediately.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the SyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param buffers The dynamic buffer sequence into which the data will be read.
 *
 * @param delim The delimiter character.
 *
 * @returns The number of bytes in the dynamic buffer sequence's get area up to
 * and including the delimiter.
 *
 * @throws std::system_error Thrown on failure.
 *
 * @note After a successful read_until operation, the dynamic buffer sequence
 * may contain additional data beyond the delimiter. An application will
 * typically leave that data in the dynamic buffer sequence for a subsequent
 * read_until operation to examine.
 *
 * @par Example
 * To read data into a @c std::string until a newline is encountered:
 * @code std::string data;
 * std::string n = std::experimental::net::read_until(s,
 *     std::experimental::net::dynamic_buffer(data), '\n');
 * std::string line = data.substr(0, n);
 * data.erase(0, n); @endcode
 * After the @c read_until operation completes successfully, the string @c data
 * contains the delimiter:
 * @code { 'a', 'b', ..., 'c', '\n', 'd', 'e', ... } @endcode
 * The call to @c substr then extracts the data up to and including the
 * delimiter, so that the string @c line contains:
 * @code { 'a', 'b', ..., 'c', '\n' } @endcode
 * After the call to @c erase, the remaining data is left in the buffer @c b as
 * follows:
 * @code { 'd', 'e', ... } @endcode
 * This data may be the start of a new line, to be extracted by a subsequent
