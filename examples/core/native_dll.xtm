;; 
;; compile a trivial native dynamic library
;;
;;  ./extempore.exe --dll --compile=./examples/core/native_dll.xtm
;;
;; --dll specifies that output should be a shared library
;;
;; after a successful compilation you should find native_dll.dll in libs/builds/
;;
;; NB: it is very important that after you load the dll
;; and before you call any other functions in the dll
;; that you call the native_dll_init() function
;; this makes sure extempores top level closures are setup
;;
;; the "native_dll_init" function is named based on your xtm filename
;; i.e. "name"+init 
;; e.g. compiling a file called mylib.xtm would result 
;; in an init of mylib_init()

;; this is NOT a standard C call site
;; so don't try calling this from C
(bind-func xtlangClosure

      (set! inc (+ inc 1))
      (+ x inc))))

;; this IS a standard C call site
;; you can bind and call this
(bind-func static plusInc
  (lambda (a:i64)

;; before you can call any static
;; function that calls a closure
;; you will need "initialize the dll"
;; extempore automagically builds you
;; a function called native_dll_init
;; which is exported can be called normally
;; do this FIRST after loading the dll
;; 
;; sometimes though you'll need to expose
;; a named function (i.e. a plugin arch)
;; for those occurences you can "name"
;; the init function by simply wrapping
;; it as below
