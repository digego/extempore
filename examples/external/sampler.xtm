;;; sampler.xtm -- how to use the builtin sampler

;; Author: Andrew Sorensen, Ben Swift
;; Keywords: extempore
;; Required dylibs: libsndfile

;;; Commentary:

;; NOTE at the moment compiling in a secondary thread is a little
;; flaky. I'm working on this so in the mean time you'll just have to
;; put up with the audio delays while compiling

;;; Code:

;; First, load the library where the sampler infrastructure is
;; located.  Have a look at this file in your editor to see how the
;; sampler works.

(sys:load "libs/external/instruments_ext.xtm")

;; Now define the sampler instrument and DSP callback function (in
;; this case, it just calls the sampler closure)

(make-instrument sampler sampler)

(bind-func dsp:DSP
  (lambda (in time chan dat)
    (cond ((< chan 2)
           (* 3.0 (sampler in time chan dat)))
	  (else 0.0))))

(dsp:set! dsp)

;; Find a stereo audio file of some kind (not mp3 or aac)
;; ogg, wav or aif should all be fine

;; then load up a few excerpts from the file
;; set-sampler-index takes 7 arguments:
;; 1) the instrument to load into (in the example above, it's 'sampler')
;; 2) the audio file to load from
;; 3) an index (from 0-127) to load into. This should be the base
;; frequency of the sample, e.g. a middle C sample should be loaded into 60.
;; 4) an offset in samples (frames without channels)
;; 5) a duration or length in samples to read
;; 6) a 'sample bank' index (starting from 0)
;; 7) a flag (0 or 1) indicating whether or not to print info about the sample

;; first let's just read in one sample
;; we'll choose an index of 60 - the midi note number for middle C
;; make sure your audio file is long enough for the params below!!
(set-sampler-index sampler "assets/samples/xmas_carol.wav" 60 0 0 0 1)

;; playing back at 60 should playback without pitch shift
(play-note (now) sampler 60 120 (* 44100 15))  ;; play 15 seconds

;; anything else will pitch shift
;; floating point is OK
(play-note (now) sampler 67.25 120 (* 44100 15)) ;; play 15 seconds

;; a loop
(define loop
  (lambda (beat dur)
    (play sampler (random 48 72) 120 dur)
    (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* .5 dur))) 'loop
              (+ beat dur)
              dur)))

;; start loop
;; uncomment and call this to start loop
;; (loop (*metro* 'get-beat 4) 8)

;; Now let's load a 'whole instrument' from a directory of samples!
(load-sampler sampler "assets/samples/piano/")

;; the final two arguments (offset and length) are zero, meaning that
;; the samper should use an offset of zero and the full length of the
;; sample (the 'default' behaviour)

;; There are other parse-filename functions provided in the
;; libs/external/instruments_ext.xtm file.  If you're having trouble, see
;; if you can use (or adapt) one of those to make sense of the
;; filenames you're trying to load into the sampler.

;; Now, back to making music: loop2 requires pc_ivl-lib
(sys:load "libs/core/pc_ivl.xtm")

(define loop2
  (lambda (beat dur root)
    (play 3 sampler 36 100 dur 0)
    (for-each (lambda (p offset)
                (play (+ offset) sampler p 100 dur) 1)
              (pc:make-chord 40 84 7
                             (pc:chord root (if (member root '(10 8))
                                                '^7
                                                '-7)))
              '(1/3 1 3/2 1 2 3 13/3))
    (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* .5 dur))) 'loop2 (+ beat dur)
              dur
              (if (member root '(0 8))
                  (random '(2 7 10))
                  (random '(0 8))))))

(loop2 (*metro* 'get-beat 4) 4 0)

;; try messing around with the ADSR parameters to see how it affects the sound
;; AD & R in milliseconds - S between 0.0 - 1.0
(set_amp_env sampler 10.0 0.0 1.0 200.0)
