Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
=============

Extempore has some library dependencies. 

On OSX:
   - LLVM 3.0
   - pthread (if not using boost)
     OR boost (if not using pthread)
   - pcre (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)

On linux:
   - LLVM 3.0 (must be built from source)
   - pthread (if not using boost)
     OR boost (if not using pthread)
   - pcre
   - jack OR portaudio
   - mesa GL (opengl)

On Windows 7:
   - LLVM 3.0
   - pcre
   - boost
   - portaudio



LLVM Install Instructions
=====================

Most of the libraries are pretty standard and will either (a) already
be installed on your system or (b) can usually be easily installed
as from binary packages.

However, LLVM *must* currently be installed from source. The reason
being that a small patch to LLParser.cpp (an LLVM source file) is 
required.

   You can get LLVM src from:
   http://www.llvm.org/

LLVM requires this small patch to the file LLParser.cpp and so must be
built from source. The patch file is availble in the extempore/extras
directory (llparser.patch).  To apply the patch just move into the
llvm/lib/AsmParser directory and then apply the llparser.patch file 
which in can be found in extempore/extras.

[~/llvm/lib/AsmParser]$ patch < ~/extempore/extras/llparser.patch 

LLVM must be version 3.0 and must be patched as above.  LLVM also
requires you to set a --prefix location (i.e. where everything will be
installed into). 

# a common build process for LLVM

$ cd ~/llvm/lib/AsmParser
$ patch < ~/extempore/extras/llparser.patch
$ cd ~/llvm
$ mkdir Build
$ ./configure --prefix=~/llvm/Build --enable-optimized
$ make -j4
$ make install


Once all of the libraries required for your platform are installed
you can compile extempore:

# firstly you must point extempore to your llvm Build directory
# by defining the shell variable EXT_LLVM_DIR

# for example
$ export EXT_LLVM_DIR=~/llvm/Build

Then you can build extempore using the all.bash shell script 

$ ./all.bash

Voila ... you should be done.

There are a couple of extra build arguments that you may need to use

1) If you wish to build against the boost library you
need to define EXT_BOOST.

2) If you want to build against the Jack audio library on Linux
you will need to define JACK_AUDIO

So to build against LLVM 3.0+ with boost and jack support you would use the
build command:

   ./all.bash -DEXT_BOOST -DJACK_AUDIO




WINDOWS 
======= 

Windows support is new but functional. Boost is mandatory for
Extempore on Windows.  You will need to build BOOST, PORTAUDIO and
LLVM 3.0+ for yourself.  These can all be built as static libs.
Unfortunately there is currently no build process supported so you're
on your own.  I have an MSVS 2010 project for extempore that can get
you started if you send me an email.

Below are a few notes that may help to get you on the right track.

Some Early Windows Build Notes (for me so I don't forget)
=========================================================

(a) Make sure you install CMake
(b) Use CMake to Build LLVM (choose 64bit option)
(c) Make sure that Debug build mode has _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=2 is set for both
:> CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG and CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG (click advanced checkbox in cmake gui) 
(d) Make sure portaudio msvc general project settings are set to static lib
(e) boost command line for bjam is:
:> bjam --build-dir=<dir> toodset=msvc link=static address-model=64 --build-type=complete stage
(f) extempore msvs project settings needs "PCRE_STATIC" to be defined if you want to build against pcre static libs
(g) extmepore msvs project needs EXT_BOOST to be defined
(h) pcreposix.lib needs to come before pcre.lib in link list
      


Running Extempore
==================

You don't need to do anyting special to run extempore:

   $ ./extempore

There are some optional command line options that you may want to use
you can get a list by running ./extempore --help

Once you've started extempore you can connect using either Telnet,
Emacs (using the included extras/extempore.el file), or vim (using
the included extras/extempore.vim).

If using Telnet the default extempore port to connect to is 7099.

If you want ot use Emacs (recommended) then you'll need to call
"M-x load-file" and then load extempore/extras/extempore.el after you've
started emacs. Then swith to a blank buffer (C-x b - new - return) 
and then (M-x scheme-mode) (M-x extempore-mode) and you're away.
(C-x C-x) to eval an expression.
  
To avoid loading extempore.el everytime you start emacs you'll
probably want to add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

   (autoload 'extempore-mode "/path/to/extempore.el" "" t)

extempore.el can be found in the extras directory.

If you want to use (g)Vim, see the instructions found in
"extras/extempore.vim".
