;;; system.xtm -- tests for Extempore "system" functionality

;; Author: Ben Swift
;; Keywords: extempore
;; Required dylibs:

;;; Commentary:

;; Any tests which excercise functionality from the CPP codebase (e.g.
;; through SchemeFFI.cpp) should be placed in here.

;; Also, tests of the scheme interpreter should go here as well.

;;; Code:

;; multi-process/IPC

(define times-5
  (lambda (a)
    (* a 5)))

(ipc:new "test-process" 17599)

(ipc:define "test-process" 'times-5 times-5)

(xtmtest-result
 (ipc:call "test-process" 'times-5 2)
 10)

;; async version - should return true, mostly in here just to check
;; that it doesn't crash

(xtmtest-result
 (ipc:call-async "test-process" 'times-5 6)
